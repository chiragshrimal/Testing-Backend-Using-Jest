```
npm init -y 

```

```

install jest for javaScript and save as dev-dependencies

npm install --save-dev jest @jest/globals

```

```

we are using CommanJs so have to use require bacause no jest.config.js file is required insted of import
and for the import use typeScript it is easy to setup (jest.config.ts file is required)

```
